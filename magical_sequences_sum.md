# Sum of Array Products for Magical Sequences

## Problem

You are given two integers, `m` and `k`, and an integer array `nums`.

A sequence of integers `seq` is called **magical** if:
- `seq` has a size of `m`.
- `0 <= seq[i] < nums.length` for all `i`.
- The binary representation of `2^{seq[0]} + 2^{seq[1]} + ... + 2^{seq[m - 1]}` has exactly `k` set bits.

The array product of this sequence is defined as

```
prod(seq) = nums[seq[0]] * nums[seq[1]] * ... * nums[seq[m - 1]]
```

Return the sum of the array products for all valid magical sequences, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Constraints
- `1 <= k <= m <= 30`  
- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`  
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8`


## Intuition and Key Observations

- A sequence `seq` of length `m` can be characterized by **counts** `c[i]` for each index `i` (how many times index `i` appears in `seq`). These counts satisfy `c[i] >= 0` and `sum_i c[i] = m`.

- For a fixed counts vector `c`, the sum
  \[S = \sum_i c[i] * 2^i\]
  is the integer whose binary representation's set bits we must count. The condition "`popcount(S) == k`" depends only on the `c[i]` values.

- All ordered sequences with the same counts `c` have the same product value `prod = \prod_i nums[i]^{c[i]}` and there are `m! / \prod_i c[i]!` ordered sequences (multinomial).

- Therefore the total contribution from counts `c` is
  \[m! * \prod_i \frac{nums[i]^{c[i]}}{c[i]!}\]
  and we need to sum this over all `c` with `sum c[i] = m` and `popcount(S(c)) = k`.

- This leads to a dynamic programming solution that processes indices `i` (bits) from low to high, tracks the carry produced when adding counts in binary, and counts how many resulting set bits we have so far.


## Algorithm (DP by bits)

We process bit positions `i = 0, 1, 2, ..., B-1`, where `B` is chosen large enough to process all carries. Since `m <= 30`, the carry cannot exceed `m`, so it's enough to take `B = nums.length + 6` (safe upper bound).

State: `dp[i][carry][pop]` = sum of contributions (the multiplicative term `\prod nums[j]^{c[j]}/c[j]!` aggregated) after processing bits `0..i-1`, with `carry` carried into bit `i`, and `pop` set bits produced so far from lower bits.

Transition for bit `i` (if `i < nums.length`): we choose how many times index `i` is used, i.e. `c` from `0..m`. The value at this position when adding `carry` is `total = c + carry`:
- Resulting bit at position `i` is `bit = total % 2`.
- New carry is `carry' = total / 2` (integer division).
- Contribution factor multiplying the DP value is `nums[i]^c / c!`.

If `i >= nums.length`, there is no `c` choice (equivalently `c = 0`), we just propagate carries to produce bits.

Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` (no bits processed, zero carry, zero popcount). After processing all `B` bits (enough to clear carries), the answer equals

```
answer = m! * dp_final[carry=0][pop = k]  (mod 1e9+7)
```


## Complexity

- Let `n = nums.length`, `m <= 30`, `B = n + 6` (constant extra). For each bit we iterate over `carry` (0..m) and `pop` (0..m) and for `i < n` also over `c` (0..m). This gives complexity roughly `O(n * m^3)` worst-case but with small constants; for `m <= 30` and `n <= 50` this is fast enough.

- Memory: `O(m^2)` per dp layer.

}

## Example usage

For the examples provided in the prompt, provide the input as a single line followed by the `nums` values. For example, example 1 (`m = 5, k = 5, nums = [1,10,100,10000,1000000]`) would be passed to the program as:

```
5 5 1 10 100 10000 1000000
```

The program prints the answer modulo `1e9+7`.


## Notes
- This solution carefully handles carry propagation across bits and uses combinatorics (multinomial) encoded via `m! / prod c[i]!` by factoring `1 / c[i]!` into the DP and multiplying by `m!` at the end.
- All arithmetic is done mod `1e9+7` and uses modular inverses for factorials.
